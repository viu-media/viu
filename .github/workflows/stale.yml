          stale-issue-message: "Greetings @{{author}},
            This bug report is like an ancient scroll detailing a legendary beast. We need to know if this creature is still roaming the lands in the latest version of `viu`. Have you seen any signs of it recently?

            Your reconnaissance is vital! If you can confirm the beast is still a threat, our heroes will prepare for battle. If we don't get an update within **14 days**, we'll assume it has vanished and archive the scroll to focus on new adventures.

            Thanks for being our trusted scout!"
          stale-pr-message:
            "Hello @{{author}}, it looks like this powerful contribution has been left in the middle of its training arc! ðŸ’ª

            We were excited to see this new technique being developed. Are you still planning to complete its training, or have you embarked on a different quest? If you need a sparring partner (reviewer) or some guidance from a senpai, just let us know!

            To keep our dojo tidy, we'll be archiving unfinished techniques. If we don't hear back within **14 days**, we'll assume it's time to close this PR for now. You can always resume your training and reopen it when you're ready to unleash its full potential.

            Thank you for your incredible effort!"
